                            Hi üëã<br />I was recently asked to improve chatroom
                            performance. The longer chats became, the more users
                            complained that everything is sluggish.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The chatroom was built in Backbone and jQuery and{" "}
                            <a href="https://swizec.com/blog/build-list-virtualization/swizec/8167">
                                I tried many ways to make it better
                            </a>. Everything was hard and cumbersome. In the end
                            I realized that re-rendering the whole list of
                            messages, even without a smart framework, is fast
                            enough. That made me wonder
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em style={{ fontSize: "1.2em" }}>
                                "Did the DOM get fast?"

                            Below are a few benchmarks. Click buttons to see
                            your own results. Charts for what I saw. :)
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>create a long list</li>
                            <li>append to it</li>
                            <li>prepend to it</li>
                            <li>insert in the middle</li>
                            <li>remove elements</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Benchmarks focus on long flat lists of nodes because
                            that's pretty common. Think chat window with
                            thousands of messages. Our goal is to find which is
                            faster
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Raw DOM with vanilla JS</li>
                            <li>React</li>
                            <li>Vue</li>
                            <li>Preact</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Don't worry, benchmarks are implemented in the
                            respective framework internally. I'm just using
                            React for the skeleton because it's what I'm used to
                            and <code>nwb</code> made it quick to set up
                            compiling and stuff. You can see{" "}
